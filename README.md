# Secure Authentication Strategies in Private Cloud Infrastructure

## Overview
This research explores **Risk-Based Authentication (RBA)** as a security enhancement for **private cloud infrastructures**, focusing on its integration within **OpenStack**. Traditional authentication mechanisms, such as **password-based authentication**, remain vulnerable to attacks like **credential stuffing and password spraying**. RBA offers a dynamic and **context-aware** security solution by evaluating user behavior and login context to **strengthen authentication without disrupting usability**.

## Key Highlights
- **Risk-Based Authentication (RBA)**: A security model that adapts authentication requirements based on user behavior and contextual factors.
- **OpenStack Integration**: Implementation of a fully functional **open-source RBA module** for OpenStack, enhancing **cloud security**.
- **Improved Usability**: Reduces reliance on traditional **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** while maintaining strong security.
- **Reference Implementation**: Provides a guiding framework for **developers and researchers** to deploy and test RBA in cloud environments.

## Research Contributions
This project is based on existing researches have been incorporated to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of **secure authentication strategies in private cloud infrastructure**.
